ALGORITHM

    The damping feedback control loop that generates K as money inflates and deflates over time is
similar to the control circuit for a robot that balances a stick.  However, in this case, the mass
of the stick and the force of gravity would be changing over time, too!

    Therefore, the algorithm must respond only to the velocity and acceleration of the target -- not
make assumptions about its mass and gravity.

    Some examples I looked at were a home-made "Segway" balancing algorithm:

An excellent balancing robot page, with dozens of references to other similar projects:

Source code in C obtained for one balancing robot:

Finally, I found a full-on Python implementation of a balancing simulation using Bang-bang,
proportional and PID controllers:

Another PID loop implementation was found in cgkit's pidcontroller.py file, which also illuminated
some errors in the www.edparadis.com PID loop implementation (see pidcontroller.py:

A more complex PID controller was found in:
